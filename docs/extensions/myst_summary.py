"""
MyST-compatible drop-in replacement for Sphinx's Autosummary extension

This extension overrides Autosummary's generation of [domain] roles
(cross-references) so that the syntax is Markdown, just as the MyST
parser expects, and not reStructuredText, as intended for Sphinx's
built-in parser.

Needless to say, this is a hack. Autosummary should be aware of the
the document parser it creates content for, but it's not. That would
require substantial upstream changes.
