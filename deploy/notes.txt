Releases
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾

To release a new version, do the following:
• Bump version number and enter current date in `mph/__init__.py`.
• Possibly add a dedicated commit, or include it in a meaningful commit.
• Tag that commit with the version number, for example: `git tag -a v0.9.0`.
• Enter the change log relative to the previous release as an annotation.
• Push the commit (but not the tag): `git push origin master`.
• Check that documentation built successfully on Read-the-Docs.
• Publish to PyPI by running `deploy/publish.py`.
• Then push the tag: `git push --tags`.
• Possibly "draft a new release" on GitHub.
